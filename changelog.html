-in tab Download products added image preview with click on Product list items
-in tab Download products added option to import and export table of product download
-in tab Download products the Product list is saved with the project
-in tabs Landsat Sentinel-2 and ASTER added option to limit DOS1 correction only to blue and green bands
-in tab Preprocessing added tool for Sentinel-3 OLCI
-in tab Preprocessing added tool Mosaic band sets for the creation of multiband mosaics
-in tab Preprocessing added tool Cloud masking of a band set which is based on the values of a classification

-in tab Band processing added tool Spectral distance for calculating pixel distance between two band sets
-in tab Band processing added tool Band combination for calculating a raster of band combinations from a band set
-in tab Postprocessing added tool Class signature for calculating the spectral signatures of classes in a classification using a band set
-in tab ROI Creation added option to autosave training input (backup file created when saving QGIS project)
-in tab Clip Multiple Rasters added option to select a vector field for iterating through each vector polygon and add field value to the output name
-in Working toolbar added possibility to plot spectral signatures of the same pixel for all the band sets (pressing the button ROI region growing then CTRL + mouse right click in the map)
-in tab Classification the threshold value if > 0 is used for all the spectral signatures;
-in tab Edit raster added vector as variable name for using vector value in expression
-in tab Batch added several new functions and changed some of the function variable names
-in tab Batch added label for checking the expression
-in tab Batch added table containing the list of functions
